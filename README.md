[Douglas Arneson](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/douglas.arneson) is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Bakar Institute of Computational Health](https://bakarinstitute.ucsf.edu) at UCSF. He earned a B.S. in Bioengineering and a Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at UCLA. His doctoral thesis entitled [Development and Application of Systems Genomics Approaches to Dissect Complex Diseases](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5jf240c4) focuses on the [integration multi-omics data to better explain the etiology of complex diseases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27612452) and [single cell sequencing to reveal target cells and pathways of concussive brain injury](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Single+cell+molecular+alterations+reveal+target+cells+and+pathways+of+concussive+brain+injury).

## Case Studies

data: https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016

### Can we predict pass/run?

### Can PFF grades help improve win percentage estimates?

### Can we predict PFF grades? Based on the model, are there any players which are over/underrated by PFF?

### Can we build a model that tells us how important each position is in today's NFL? Based on how much that position helps a team win, can we maximize budget to make a better team?

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
